# Notes

## Technical details
* For character segmentation OpenCV provides cv2.findContours
    * Maybe segmenting on words is better than characters for code
* Once characters are segmented I can probably use a simple nerual net or maybe a CNN to do OCR
    * This might not work super well but it's a start
    * I think I can somehow use an RNN to my advantage but I'm not sure
